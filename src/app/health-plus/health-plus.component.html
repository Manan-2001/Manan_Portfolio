        <p class="cp">
          During my <strong>final year project</strong>, I developed an <strong>Android application</strong>
          called <strong>Health Plus</strong>. The goal was to create a user-friendly platform
          where users could <strong>book doctor appointments</strong>, <strong>order lab tests</strong>, and
          manage their profiles through <strong>login</strong> and <strong>registration activities</strong>. This
          project was built using <strong>Java</strong> in <strong>Android Studio</strong>, with <strong>Firebase as the
          database</strong> and <strong>Lottie animations</strong> for an enhanced user interface.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          One of the key features I implemented was the appointment booking
          system. Users can browse through a list of available doctors, view
          their profiles and specialties, and book appointments at their
          convenience. Additionally, I developed a module for ordering lab
          tests, allowing users to select tests, schedule appointments for
          sample collection, and receive results directly within the app.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          To manage user authentication and profile management, I incorporated
          login and registration activities. New users can register by providing
          necessary details, while existing users can log in to access their
          profiles, view their appointment history, and manage their lab test
          orders.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          To enhance the user interface, I used Lottie animations, creating
          smooth and visually appealing transitions that make the app more
          engaging and enjoyable to use. Firebase was utilized as the backend
          database, providing real-time data synchronization and secure storage
          for user information and activity logs.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          The development process involved using Java to write the core
          application logic and Android Studio as the integrated development
          environment. I structured the application into different modules,
          making the codebase modular and maintainable. Firebase integration
          allowed for real-time data updates and user authentication, ensuring a
          seamless and secure user experience.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          Throughout the project, I conducted extensive testing to ensure all
          features functioned correctly and the application performed well under
          various conditions. I also optimized the code and assets for better
          performance and responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          The Health Plus Android application successfully combines
          functionality with an engaging user experience, showcasing my skills
          in mobile app development and user interface design. This project
          highlights my ability to use modern technologies to create interactive
          and efficient mobile applications. I gained deeper insights into Java
          and Android development, enhanced my proficiency in Firebase for
          backend services, and learned effective techniques for integrating
          animations into mobile applications. This project also improved my
          ability to manage a personal project from conception to completion,
          including planning, development, testing, and deployment.
