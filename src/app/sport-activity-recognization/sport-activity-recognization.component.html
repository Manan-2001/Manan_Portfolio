        <p class="cp">
          I developed a <strong>Sports Activity Recognition System</strong> as an academic
          project during my MCA program. The objective of this project was to
          train a model capable of predicting sports activities from input
          sports videos and images. This project employed advanced <strong>machine
          learning</strong> and <strong>deep learning techniques</strong> to achieve high accuracy in
          sports recognition.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          To build the model, I utilized the <strong>ResNet-50 deep learning algorithm</strong>,
          a powerful convolutional neural network known for its efficiency in
          <strong>image and video classification tasks</strong>. The model was trained using a
          comprehensive <strong>Sport Image Dataset</strong>, which provided a wide range of
          sports activities for accurate classification. Additionally, I used
          <strong>TensorFlow</strong> as the primary framework for implementing and training the
          model.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          The system incorporates <strong>Label Binarizer</strong> for encoding the sports
          labels, enabling the model to differentiate between various sports
          activities effectively. The model can predict the type of sport from
          both images and videos, making it versatile for different input types.
          Throughout the training process, extensive image and video
          classification techniques were applied to enhance the model's
          performance.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          The Sports Activity Recognition System achieved a remarkable training
          accuracy of <strong>96.29%</strong>, indicating its proficiency in accurately
          identifying sports activities from input data. This high level of
          accuracy underscores the effectiveness of the ResNet-50 algorithm and
          the robustness of the dataset used.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">
          This project provided valuable hands-on experience in applying deep
          learning algorithms to real-world problems, showcasing my ability to
          leverage advanced technologies for developing intelligent systems. It
          also demonstrated my skills in data preprocessing, model training, and
          performance evaluation, essential for any machine learning and deep
          learning project.
